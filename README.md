**1. Portfolio Introduction**

- This portfolio serves as a showcase of my work throughout the course SIS750: Data Analysis, emphasizing skills in programming, data visualization, data wrangling, and statistical analysis. It provides an opportunity to review, revise, and organize my deliverables (Codebook and Presentation) in a comprehensive manner. Key elements include demonstrating proficiency in coding, presenting effective visualizations, showcasing data manipulation techniques, and showcasing analytical insights.

**2. Codebook Description**

- For my codebook assignment, I was tasked with utilizing a dataset from the Arab Barometer Wave VI, conducted between July 2020 and April 2021. The dataset comprises three segments of the survey: Part 1, Part 2, and Part 3.

- As part of the assignment requirements, I was expected to demonstrate my data wrangling skills by producing a codebook. The dataset originates from the Arab Barometer, which conducts national surveys across the Middle East.

- To fulfill the assignment, the following steps were required:

- Download the Wave VI data from the Arab Barometer download zone Limit the sample to surveys conducted in Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia. Clean the dataset to extract the following variables: c_name: country name source: "Arab Barometer" r_id: respondent ID r_year: year of interview r_month: month of interview r_swt: survey weight r_female: binary indicator for female p_ideology: left-right ideological self-placement p_interest: interest in politics p_economy: evaluation of the national economy over the past year 4 measures of satisfaction with and/or preference for democracy

- The final deliverable is a cleaned dataset containing these specified variables and a deliverable codebook.

**3. Presentation Description** 

- For my Presentation, I utilized data Compiled and curated in 2022, Urban Social Disorder Version 3.0, which provides a comprehensive overview of societal conflict dynamics across various regions. My analyses provides us with valuable insights into the nature and magnitude of societal conflicts in various regions.I examined the types of societal conflicts and analysis of participants involved in these societal conflicts

- To fulfill the assignment, the following steps were required:

- The assignment entailed creating a 5-7 minute recorded audiovisual presentation using R Markdown to showcase visualization skills. It included a topical motivation, data description, and two analysis slides. The presentation starts with a title slide introducing the topic and author information, followed by a slide describing the chosen dataset. The subsequent slides present analysis: the first focusing on a key variable, and the second featuring two visuals comparing data on a second variable. One visual should illustrate the full sample distribution, while the other compares sub-groups, utilizing patchwork or facet for plot creation.

- The final deliverable is a cleaned slide deck containing these specified conditions.

**4. Exemplary Code Chunk**

- This code chunk showcases a graph from a previous deliverable-- the poster. 

**5. Analyst Resume**

- There is an updated resume tailored to a position in data analytics
